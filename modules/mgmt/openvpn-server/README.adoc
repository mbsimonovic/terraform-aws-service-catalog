This Terraform Module deploys an https://openvpn.net/[OpenVPN Server].


image::../../../_docs/openvpn-architecture.png?raw=true[OpenVPN server architecture]
This server acts as the entrypoint to your AWS account. You must connect to it with an OpenVPN client before you can
connect to any of your other servers, which are in private subnets. This way, you minimize the surface area you expose
to attackers, and can focus all your efforts on locking down just a single server.

== Features

* An AMI to run on the OpenVPN Server
* An Auto Scaling Group of size 1 (for fault tolerance)
* An Elastic IP Address (EIP)
* IAM Role and IAM instance profile
* Security group.
* A DNS record
* Harden the OS by installing `fail2ban`, `ntp`, `auto-update`, `ip-lockdown`, and more
* Send all logs and metrics to CloudWatch
* Configure alerts in CloudWatch for CPU, memory, and disk space usage
* Manage SSH access with IAM groups using `ssh-grunt`




Under the hood, this is all implemented using Terraform modules from the Gruntwork
[package-openvpn](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-openvpn) repo.


== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://gruntwork.io/service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catallog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!

=== Core concepts

To understand core concepts like why you should use an OpenVPN server, how to connect to the vpn, how to use the
VPN server to connect to other systems on the AWS VPC, see the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-openvpn/blob/master/modules/openvpn-server/README.md[openvpn-server
documentation] documentation in the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-openvpn[package-openvpn] repo.

== The OpenVPN Server AMI

The OpenVPN Server AMI is defined using the [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) template under `packer/openvpn-server.json`.
This template configures the AMI to:

1. Install OpenVPN server, all its dependencies, and the Gruntwork admin tools.
1. Run the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/ssh-grunt[ssh-grunt module] so that
   developers can upload their public SSH keys to IAM and use those SSH keys, along with their IAM user names, to SSH
   to the OpenVPN Server (typically for troubleshooting only).
1. Run the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/auto-update[auto-update module] so
   that the OpenVPN Server installs security updates automatically.
1. Optionally run the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-aws-monitoring/tree/master/modules/logs/syslog[syslog module] to
   automatically rotate and rate limit syslog so that the server doesn't run out of disk space from large volumes
   of logs.


== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
  testing (but not direct production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
  https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/:[Gruntwork Reference Architecture], and it shows you how we build an
  end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
  configure CI / CD for your apps and infrastructure.


== Operate

=== Day-to-day operations

* https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban[`fail2ban`] bans IP addresses that cause too many failed login attempts. The OpenVPN server is configured with `fail2ban` as a security measure. See the  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/fail2ban[`fail2ban` module] for more information.
* Use the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-openvpn/blob/master/modules/openvpn-admin/README.md[openvpn-admin] utility to requests new certificates and, for administrators, to revoke existing certificates.
