== Features

* The VPC itself.
* Subnets, which are isolated subdivisions within the VPC. There are 3 "tiers" of subnets: public, private app, and
   private persistence.
* Route tables, which provide routing rules for the subnets.
* Internet Gateways to route traffic to the public Internet from public subnets.
* NATs to route traffic to the public Internet from private subnets.



== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://gruntwork.io/service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catallog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!


Under the hood, this is all implemented using Terraform modules from the Gruntwork
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc[module-vpc] repo. If you don't have access to this repo, email
support@gruntwork.io.


=== Core concepts

To understand core concepts like what's a VPC, how subnets are configured, how network ACLs work, and more, see the
documentation in the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc[module-vpc] repo.

=== Repo organization

* link:/modules[modules]: The main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
* link:/examples[examples]: This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* link:/test[test]: Automated tests for the modules and examples.




== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
  testing (but not direct production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
  https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/:[Gruntwork Reference Architecture], and it shows you how we build an
  end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
* https://gruntwork.io/guides/automation-and-workflows/how-to-configure-a-production-grade-ci-cd-setup-for-apps-and-infrastructure-code/[How
  to configure a production-grade CI/CD workflow for application and infrastructure code]: step-by-step guide on how to
  configure CI / CD for your apps and infrastructure.
