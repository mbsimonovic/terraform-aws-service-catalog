== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://gruntwork.io/service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catallog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!


== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and testing (but not direct production usage). For a demonstration of how to use this module, see the link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing/mgmt/bastion-host[bastion host example].

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
