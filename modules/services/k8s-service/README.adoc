== Features

* Deploy your application containers on to Kubernetes
* Zero-downtime rolling deployments
* Auto scaling and auto healing
* Configuration management and Secrets management
* Ingress and Service endpoints
* Service discovery with Kubernetes DNS
* Managed with Helm




== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/aws-service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catalog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!

Under the hood, this is all implemented using Terraform modules from the Gruntwork
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services[helm-kubernetes-services] repo. If you don't have access to this repo, email
support@gruntwork.io.


=== Core concepts

* https://gruntwork.io/guides/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-production-grade-kubernetes-cluster-aws/#core_concepts[Kubernetes core concepts]: learn about Kubernetes architecture (control plane, worker nodes), access control (authentication, authorization), resources (pods, controllers, services, config, secrets), and more.
* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/blob/master/core-concepts.md#how-do-you-run-applications-on-kubernetes[How do you run applications on Kubernetes?]
* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services/blob/master/core-concepts.md#what-is-helm[What is Helm?]
* _https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action[Kubernetes in Action]_: the best book we've found for getting up and running with Kubernetes.


=== Repo organization

* link:/modules[modules]: the main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
* link:/examples[examples]: This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* link:/test[test]: Automated tests for the modules and examples.


== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
  testing (but not direct production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
  https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/:[Gruntwork Reference Architecture], and it shows you how we build an
  end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
