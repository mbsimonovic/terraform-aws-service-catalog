== Features

* Configure Listener Rules
* Zero-downtime rolling deployment
* Create Route53 record

== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/aws-service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catallog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!

Under the hood, this is all implemented using Terraform modules from the Gruntwork
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-asg[module-asg] repo. If you don't have access to this repo, email
support@gruntwork.io.


https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html[ASG Documentation]: Amazon's docs for ASG that cover core concepts such as launch templates, launch configuration and auto scaling groups.


== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
  testing (but not direct production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
  https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/[Gruntwork Reference Architecture]:, and it shows you how we build an
  end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
