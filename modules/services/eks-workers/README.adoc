== Features

* Deploy self-managed worker nodes in an Auto Scaling Group
* Deploy managed workers nodes in a Managed Node Group
* Zero-downtime, rolling deployment for updating worker nodes
* Auto scaling and auto healing
* For Nodes:
    - Server-hardening with fail2ban, ip-lockdown, auto-update, and more
    - Manage SSH access via IAM groups via ssh-grunt
    - CloudWatch log aggregation
    - CloudWatch metrics and alerts




== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catalog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!

Under the hood, this is all implemented using Terraform modules from the Gruntwork
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks[terraform-aws-eks] repo. If you don't have access to this repo, email
support@gruntwork.io.


=== Core concepts

To understand core concepts like what is Kubernetes, the different worker types, how to authenticate to Kubernetes, and
more, see the documentation in the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks[terraform-aws-eks] repo.

=== Repo organization

* link:/modules[modules]: the main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
* link:/examples[examples]: This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* link:/test[test]: Automated tests for the modules and examples.


== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
  testing (but not direct production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
  https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/:[Gruntwork Reference Architecture], and it shows you how we build an
  end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
* https://gruntwork.io/guides/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-production-grade-kubernetes-cluster-aws/#deployment_walkthrough[How to deploy a production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS]: A step-by-step guide for deploying a production-grade EKS cluster on AWS using the code in this repo.




== Manage

For information on registering the worker IAM role to the EKS control plane, refer to the
link:core-concepts.md#iam-roles-and-kubernetes-api-access[IAM Roles and Kubernetes API Access] section of the
documentation.

For information on how to manage your EKS cluster, including how to deploy Pods on Fargate, how to associate IAM roles
to Pod, how to upgrade your EKS cluster, and more, see the documentation in the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks[terraform-aws-eks] repo.




== Contributions

Contributions to this repo are very welcome and appreciated! If you find a bug or want to add a new feature or even contribute an entirely new module, we are very happy to accept pull requests, provide feedback, and run your changes through our automated test suite.

Please see https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/#contributing-to-the-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[Contributing to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library] for instructions.
