This module creates a public static website using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html[S3] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/index.html[CloudFront] on https://aws.amazon.com[AWS]. The website can contain static HTML, CSS, JS, and images.

== Features
* Offload storage and serving of static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images) to a public S3 bucket configured as a website.
* Create additional buckets to store your website access logs, and your CloudFront access logs.
* Deploy a CloudFront Distribution in front of the public S3 bucket for your website domain.
* Optionally:
    * Create a Route 53 entry in IPV4 and IPV6 formats to route requests to your domain name to the public S3 bucket,
    * And associate an existing TLS certificate issued by Amazon's Certificate Manager (ACM) for your domain.




== Learn

Serving static content from S3 rather than from your own app server can significantly reduce the load on your server, allowing it to  focus on serving dynamic data. This saves money and makes your website run faster. For even bigger improvements in performance, deploy a CloudFront Content Distribution Network (CDN) in front of the S3 bucket.

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/aws-service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catalog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!



=== Core concepts

This module deploys a public website, so the S3 bucket and objects with it are readable by the public. It also is hosted in a Public Hosted Zone in Route 53. You may provide a `hosted_zone_id` in [variables](./variables.tf), or you may provide the `base_domain_name` associated with your Public Hosted Zone in Route 53, optionally along with any tags that must match that zone in `base_domain_name_tags`. If you do the latter, this module will find the hosted zone id for you.

For more info on why you would use S3 to store static content, why you may want a CDN in front of it, how to access the
website, and how to configure SSL, check out the documentation for the
[s3-static-website](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-static-assets/tree/master/modules/s3-static-website) and
[s3-cloudfront](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-static-assets/tree/master/modules/s3-cloudfront) modules.

== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
  testing (but not direct production usage).


=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
