== Features

* Deploy a mock VPC
* Configure three tiers of subnets: public, private app, private persistence
* Set up route tables
* Deploy Internet Gateways and NAT Gateways
* Create VPC endpoints




== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://gruntwork.io/service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catallog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!

=== Core concepts

* https://gruntwork.io/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws/#core_concepts[VPC Core Concepts]:
  Or VPC deployment guide walks you through all the basics you need to know to do networking in AWS, including VPCs,
  subnets, route tables, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, Security Groups, Network ACLs, and more.

=== Repo organization

* link:/modules[modules]: The main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
* link:/examples[examples]: This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* link:/test[test]: Automated tests for the modules and examples.




== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
  testing (but not direct production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
  https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/:[Gruntwork Reference Architecture], and it shows you how we build an
  end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
* https://gruntwork.io/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws/[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on
  AWS]: A step-by-step guide for deploying a production-grade VPC on AWS using the code in this repo.
