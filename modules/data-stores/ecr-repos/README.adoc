== Features

* Create and manage multiple ECR repositories
* Store private Docker images for use in any Docker Orchestration system (e.g., Kubernetes, ECS, etc)
* Share repositories across accounts
* Fine grained access control
* Automatically scan Docker images for security vulnerabilities


== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catalog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html[ECR documentation]: Amazon's docs for ECR that
  cover core concepts such as repository URLs, image scanning, and access control.



== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
  testing (but not direct production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
  https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/:[Gruntwork Reference Architecture], and it shows you how we build an
  end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
