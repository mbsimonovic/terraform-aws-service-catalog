This folder contains code to deploy a Memcached Cluster using Amazon ElastiCache. The cluster is managed by AWS and automatically handles automatic node
discovery, recovery from failures, patching and the ability to scale to large clusters of nodes.

== Features

* Deploy a fully-managed Memcached cluster
* Automatic detection and recovery from cache node failures
* Automatic discovery of nodes within a cluster
* CloudWatch Alarms for alerting when CPU, memory, and disk metrics exceed certain thresholds
* Integrate with Kubernetes Service Discovery

== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/aws-service-catalog/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catallog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/WhatIs.html[Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached documentation]: Amazon's ElastiCache for Memcached docs that
  cover core concepts such as the options and versions supported, security, backup & restore, and monitoring.
* _https://dataintensive.net[Designing Data Intensive Applications]_: the best book we've found for understanding data
  systems, including relational databases, NoSQL, replication, sharding, consistency, and so on.

== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
  testing (but not direct production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
  https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/:[Gruntwork Reference Architecture], and it shows you how we build an
  end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
