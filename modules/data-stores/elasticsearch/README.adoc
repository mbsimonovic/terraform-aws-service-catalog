This folder contains code to deploy an Amazon Elasticsearch Service cluster managed by AWS.

Amazon Elasticsearch Service makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch. It is a fully managed service that delivers Elasticsearchâ€™s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads. For more information about Elasticsearch and its uses, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-elasticsearch-service.html[Amazon Elasticsearch Service developer guide] and the https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/getting-started/[Getting Started] page.

== Features

* Deploy a fully-managed native Elasticsearch cluster in a VPC
* Use VPC-based security
    * If you use AWS's default VPC, which contains public subnets, your Elasticsearch cluster is still only accessible from within the VPC. It is not publicly accessible. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-vpc.html#es-vpc-security[See these docs] for more information.
* Leverage zone awareness, i.e., deployment of Elasticsearch nodes across Availability Zones
* Automatic nightly snapshots
* CloudWatch Alarms for alerting when CPU, memory, and disk metrics exceed certain thresholds


== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/aws-service-catalog//[Gruntwork Service Catalog], a collection of
reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Service Catalog before, make
sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-service-catallog/[How to use the Gruntwork
Service Catalog]!

=== Introductory documentation:
* https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/[About Amazon Elasticsearch Service]
* https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/features/[Features of Amazon ES]
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-elasticsearch-service.html[Developer Guide]: Contains the main documentation on how to use Amazon ES and answers questions such as "What is Amazon Elasticsearch Service?"
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_ES_Stream.html[Streaming CloudWatch monitoring logs to Amazon Elasticsearch Service]



== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-learning-and-testing[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder]: The
  `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning,
  experimenting, and testing (but not direct production usage).
* https://aws.amazon.com/free/[AWS Free tier]: Using Amazon ES on Amazon's free tier is a great way to get started, but it has limited features and does not include encryption at rest, ultra warm data notes, or advanced security options such as fine-grained access control. The free tier does allow multiple availability zones, VPC-based access control, TLS-only requests, and node-to-node encryption.


=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples/for-production[examples/for-production folder]: The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
  code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
  https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/:[Gruntwork Reference Architecture], and it shows you how we build an
  end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
