# Gruntwork Access

![Maintained by Gruntwork](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-gruntwork.io-%235849a6.svg)
![Terraform version](https://img.shields.io/badge/tf-%3E%3D1.0.0-blue.svg)

You can use this Terraform module to grant the Gruntwork team access to your AWS account to for either:

1. Deploying a [Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/).

2. Helping your team with troubleshooting.

Under the hood, this module creates an [IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in your
AWS account that the Gruntwork team can assume. This allows the Gruntwork team to securely access your AWS accounts
without having to create, share, or manage credentials.

## Features

- Create an IAM role that grants Gruntwork access to your AWS accounts

- Choose the Managed IAM Policy to grant

- Require MFA for assuming the IAM role

- Grant access to your own security account (required for Reference Architecture deployments)

### Core concepts

- [What is the Gruntwork Reference Architecture?](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/)

## Deploy

### Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

- [examples/for-learning-and-testing folder](/examples/for-learning-and-testing): The
    `examples/for-learning-and-testing` folder contains standalone sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and
    testing (but not direct production usage).

### Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

- [examples/for-production folder](/examples/for-production): The `examples/for-production` folder contains sample
    code optimized for direct usage in production. This is code from the
    [Gruntwork Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/:), and it shows you how we build an
    end-to-end, integrated tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog.
    configure CI / CD for your apps and infrastructure.
