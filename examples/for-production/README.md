# Examples for production

This folder contains standalone examples of how to use the modules in the [modules folder](/modules) that are optimized 
for direct usage in production. This is code from the [Gruntwork Reference 
Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/), and it shows you how we build an end-to-end, integrated
tech stack on top of the Gruntwork Service Catalog. If you are just looking to experiment with or learn about the 
Gruntwork Service Catalog and aren't quite ready to go to production, head over to the 
[examples/for-learning-and-testing folder](/examples/for-learning-and-testing) instead.
