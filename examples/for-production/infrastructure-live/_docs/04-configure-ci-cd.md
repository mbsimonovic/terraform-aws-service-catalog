# Configure CI / CD

In the previous section, you saw how [to deploy your apps into the Reference Architecture](03-deploy-apps.md). Now it's 
time to see how to configure a CI / CD pipeline to automate deployments.

* [CI / CD pipeline for app code](#ci--cd-pipeline-for-app-code): How to configure a CI / CD pipeline for application 
  code, such as a Ruby, Python, PHP, or Java web service packaged with Packer or Docker.
* [CI / CD pipeline for infrastructure code](#ci--cd-pipeline-for-infrastructure-code): How to configure a CI / CD 
  pipeline, for infrastructure code, such as Terraform modules that configure your VPCs, databases, DNS settings, etc.

## Next steps

Now that your code is built, tested, and deployed, it's time to take a look at [Monitoring, Alerting, and
Logging](05-monitoring-alerting-logging.md).
