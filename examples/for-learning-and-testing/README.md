# Examples for learning and testing

This folder contains standalone examples of how to use the modules in the [modules folder](/modules) that are optimized 
for learning, experimenting, and testing (but not direct production usage). If you want to quickly try out one of the
modules in the Gruntwork Service Catalog, head into one of the folders, and follow the instructions in the README! If
you are looking for examples of how to use the modules in the Gruntwork Service Catalog directly in production, head
over to the [examples/for-production folder](/examples/for-production) instead.
