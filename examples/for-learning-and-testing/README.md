# Examples for learning and testing

This folder contains standalone examples of how to use the modules in the [modules folder](/modules) that are optimized 
for learning, experimenting, and testing (but not direct production usage). Most of these examples use Terraform 
directly to make it easy to fill in dependencies that are convenient for testing, but not necessarily those you'd use 
in production: e.g., default VPCs or mock database URLs. If you are looking for examples of how to use the modules in 
the Gruntwork Service Catalog directly in production, head over to the 
[examples/for-production folder](/examples/for-production) instead.
